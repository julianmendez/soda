\newcommand{\I}[1]{\ensuremath{{#1}^{\mathcal{I}}}}

The semantics for \Soda can be defined as follows.


An interpretation of a \Soda formula is a pair $\mathcal{I} = \langle \Delta _\mathcal{\I} , \I{\cdot} \rangle$, where $\Delta$ is the domain and $\I{\cdot}$ is the interpretation function.

They are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\I{f =_{S} g}$ can be read as replacing every free occurrence of $f$ by $g$ in scope $S$

    \item $\I{\sif b \sthen e_{1} \selse e_{2}}$ = \I{e_{1}} if $b$ is true, or \I{e_{2}} if $b$ is false

    \item $\slet f_{1} = g_{1}, \ldots f_{n} = g_{n} \sdin e$ =
    \I{e[g_{1} / f_{1}, g_{n} / f_{n}]}, which reads as the interpretation of
    replacing in $e$ every free occurrence of $f_{1}$ by $g_{1}$, $f_{2}$ by $g_{2}$, and so on until replacing $f_{n}$ by $g_{n}$
\end{itemize}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f, f_{i}$ are variable names for lambda expressions
    \item $g, g_{i}$ are typed lambda expressions
    \item $S$ is a scope
\end{itemize}


In addition, we can operate on a Monad with the following definitions

$\I{bind(a, b)} = $
