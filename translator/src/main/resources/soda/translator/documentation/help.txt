Usage:
  soda scala [OPTION] SODA_SCALA_INPUT
or
  soda scala SODA_INPUT SCALA_OUTPUT

where

  SODA_SCALA_INPUT is used to create the Soda input file and Scala output file.
If it is a directory, it scans recursively the directory to translate Soda files.
If the extension is .soda, the output file has extension .scala .
Otherwise, the extension .soda and .scala are appended to the input and output files respectively.


  SODA_INPUT is the Soda input file, regardless of the extension

  SCALA_OUTPUT is the Scala output file, regardless of the extension


OPTION:

  -p, --package
    visit each Soda package and for each package, translate all Soda source files into a single Package.scala file.

Soda-to-Coq translator

Usage:
  soda coq SODA_COQ_INPUT
or
  soda coq SODA_INPUT COQ_OUTPUT

where

  SODA_COQ_INPUT is used for the Soda input file and Coq output file.
If it is a directory, it scans recursively the directory to translate Soda files.
If the extension is .soda, the output file has extension .v .


  SODA_INPUT is the input file containing Soda snippets

  COQ_OUTPUT is the output file for Coq snippets
