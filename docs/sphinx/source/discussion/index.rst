**Soda** (Symbolic Objective Descriptive Analysis) is a human-centered specification language
to describe, formalize, and prototype abstract ideas. It has been originally designed to
formalize ethical constraints. It allows to model entities as in object-oriented programming
languages, and to model functions as in functional programming languages. Its main purpose is
to be very clear and to express what it is intended to express.
